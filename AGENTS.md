## Project Overview

**NachOS** (package `sc2nachos`) — an event-driven StarCraft II bot API for Python, built directly on
`s2clientprotocol`. It replaces `python-sc2` as the client interface for the bot
[AvocaDOS](https://github.com/maxnus/AvocaDOS), and is intended to be published for other bot authors.

The migration plan lives in the AvocaDOS repo at `docs/plans/nachOS-plan.md`, with its rationale in
`docs/plans/nachOS-initial-prompt.md`. How to decide which game ids are real, and to refresh them after a patch,
is in `docs/curating-ids.md`.

## Python

Use this repository's own environment, `.venv`, which `uv sync --extra dev` creates, and run every tool
through `uv run`, as CI does. Never system Python, and never assume anything about what else is checked out
next to this repository.

**`Path.read_text` and `Path.write_text` default to the locale encoding here, which is cp1252.** Pass
`encoding="utf-8"` to both, or an em dash written back to a source file silently becomes invalid UTF-8
and ruff refuses to read it.

**A `Final` dataclass field can only be set by the generated `__init__`**, and pyright rejects any later
assignment, in `__post_init__` too. A field that is fetched rather than passed in comes from a classmethod that
calls the constructor, as `_Game.start` does.

## Core design rules

These are the non-negotiables. They exist because this library is published for others, not just used by AvocaDOS.

- **No module-level mutable state, anywhere.** NachOS never creates or exposes a singleton. It exposes an
  instance-based `Api`; the consuming bot decides whether to make one global. Two `Api` instances must be
  able to coexist in one process.
- **The API is instantiated, never subclassed.** Do not document, encourage or design for bot authors inheriting
  from `Api`, and never add a mixin or extension hook for them to hang helpers on. Their helpers belong in
  their own modules as ordinary functions. A felt need to subclass is a signal that NachOS is missing an API —
  treat it as a bug report against this library, not as a pattern to support.
- **`Api.__init__` must be cheap and must not require a live connection.** Consumers construct it at import
  time so that `@api.event.on(...)` decorators can run as their modules load. Connecting happens in
  `run_local` / `run_ladder`, which take an already-built instance.
- **No AvocaDOS-shaped quirks.** Nothing may exist in NachOS solely to make something work in AvocaDOS. If in
  doubt, the awkwardness stays in AvocaDOS. Better still, fix it so neither side needs it.
- **NachOS owes python-sc2 nothing.** This is a new package, not a fork and not a compatible replacement — no API
  compatibility, no naming, no behavior. python-sc2 is a reference for *what the game requires*, never for *how to
  express it*. When porting, the question is never "what does python-sc2 do here" but "what should this do", and
  where it is wrong or awkward NachOS must be right, even if that means the consuming bot has to change. The
  failure mode is silent: matching the reference feels like diligence, which is how its bugs and its internal
  development names get copied in. Already caught: `Point2.rounded` there is `math.floor`; `Rect` subclasses
  `Point2` and so has a `distance_to`; `PUNISHERGRENADES` is what a player calls concussive shells. Wherever
  NachOS behaves differently in a way a bot moving over could trip on, add it to
  `docs/migrating-from-python-sc2.md`, concisely.
- **Scope:** anything useful to any bot maker, if it is (or can be made) acceptable quality — protocol, state, data
  model, units, orders, events, geometry, pathfinding, map analysis, generic utilities. Not: strategy, build
  orders, combat micro, roles, economy management.
- **The protocol transport is injectable.** Everything above it must be testable with no game client running,
  against recorded observation fixtures.
- **Performance matters.** This code sits in the bot's hot loop. Do not add abstraction layers that cost step time.

## Conventions

Carried over from AvocaDOS, so the two codebases read alike:

- **Imports**: separate stdlib, third-party and internal imports with blank lines.
- **Keyword-only args**: use `*` in signatures liberally.
- **One class per file** (except small data classes). File named after the class, lowercase.
- **Type hints** on all parameters and return types.
- **Docstrings** on all public functions and classes, but without parameter/return sections.
- **`__all__`** only where it earns its place — package `__init__.py` files that curate a public surface.
- **`TYPE_CHECKING` guard** for imports that would otherwise be circular.
- **loguru**, not stdlib `logging`.
- **Errors**: a failure of the library's own raises a subclass of `NachOSError`, which also subclasses the
  built-in it is a case of, where one fits: `ConnectionClosedError` is a `ConnectionError`. Misuse, such as a bad
  argument, raises the built-in (`ValueError`, `TypeError`, `IndexError`). A dependency's exception is translated
  where it enters, with `raise ... from`, and never reaches the caller.
- **US spelling** everywhere in code, comments, docstrings and docs — `behavior`, `initialize`, `summarize`,
  `color`, `center`. The exception is generated identifiers: `ids/raw/` mirrors Blizzard's own names verbatim
  (`BuildinProgressNonCancellable`), and those are data, never to be "corrected".
- Line length 120. `ruff check` and `ruff format --check` must pass.
- **One game loop is a step.** Above the protocol layer time is counted in steps -- `Api.step`,
  `steps_per_turn`, `steps_to_seconds` -- and the bot's own cycle is a turn, which nothing counts. The protocol
  layer keeps Blizzard's `game_loop`, because the messages it hands back carry that field, and `Api.play` is
  the one place the two meet. Never write "frame" for either.
- **What the library shares is read-only.** Anything NachOS hands a bot while keeping it -- the map's grids, and
  the state's -- is a `Grid`, which has no way to write to it. A `MutableGrid` is what a bot builds for itself,
  and what every grid derived from either is.
- **Where a finding goes**: a rule that shapes code not yet written goes here, in a line or two. A fact about one
  piece of code goes beside that code, in its docstring or a comment. The evidence goes in the commit message or
  PR, and the steps for one kind of task in `docs/`.

## Review checklist

Each of these came from a real bug found in review, mostly in code that looked correct and passed its tests.

- **Annotate as tightly as the value allows.** `Self` for type-preserving operations, exact tuple arity
  (`tuple[float, float]`, not `tuple[float, ...]`), fixed-length returns where the count is in the name, real
  protobuf types under `TYPE_CHECKING`.
- **No false IS-A.** Types of different shape must not inherit from each other — `Point3` is not a `Point2`, a
  `Rect` is not a point. Share behavior through a non-public base instead. A subtype claim that is not
  substitutable makes every downstream bug typecheck cleanly.
- **Never silently discard data.** An operation that cannot preserve a coordinate, a field, or a dimension must
  raise, with a message naming both operands and the explicit conversion. Padding and truncation hide bugs.
- **Numeric checks must accept numpy scalars.** Only `numpy.float64` subclasses `float`; `float32` and the
  integer types subclass neither. Use `numbers.Real`, ordered *after* the concrete types — the ABC check is
  roughly 3x slower, so the common path must not reach it.
- **A `tuple` subclass must define `__radd__` and `__rmul__`.** Otherwise `(1, 2) + point` inherits concatenation
  and `2 * point` inherits repetition, both returning a wrong answer with no error.
- **`__contains__` has no reflected form.** Return a bool, never `NotImplemented` — it is truthy, so
  `"banana" in rect` answers `True`.
- **Every exported name is a promise.** No public API without a caller or a test that shows why it exists, and no
  second spelling of an operation that already exists.
- **Measure before claiming.** Benchmark competing shapes rather than reasoning about them; grep for real call
  sites before calling something hot.
- **A name must not claim behavior the code lacks.** The most common defect found in review, and the one tests
  never catch: `rescale` was a plain `lerp`, and `Area.size` meant area for two shapes and a point count for the
  third. Read the body, then ask what the name promised.
- **Test invariants across implementations, not one at a time.** `closest_point_to` returned a tile center from
  `TileSet` and a boundary point from `Tile` and `Rectangle`, and every per-class test passed. Parametrize one
  probe over every implementation of the interface.
- **A base class without `__slots__` gives every subclass a `__dict__`**, which makes their own slots inert and
  lets attributes be set on a frozen value. `functools.cached_property` needs that dict, so a class wanting one
  declares no slots, and a `cached_property` cannot override an abstract `property`.
- **Anything that picks or orders the elements of a set must sort them first.** Two equal `frozenset`s can
  iterate in different orders, depending on how each was built, which made a seeded game unreproducible.
- **An unset proto2 enum field reads as its first declared value, not zero.** `ResponseJoinGame.error` unset is
  `MissingParticipation`, which is truthy, so reading it blind refuses every successful join. Gate optional enum
  reads with `HasField`, spelled out at the call site: the stubs type its argument as a `Literal` of field names,
  which a helper taking `field: str` defeats.
- **`isinstance` against an ABC costs ~6x a plain class when it misses**, so a type switch over `Area`
  implementations pays that for every branch it rejects. Prefer a virtual method, which is also open to new shapes.
- **Reading a field out of a protobuf message costs over ten times a slot read.** A value read many times a turn
  is copied out once, when the observation arrives.

## Talking to the game

- **The authoritative protocol documentation is the comments in `sc2api.proto`**, and the `s2clientprotocol`
  package on PyPI ships only generated code, which carries none of them. Read the source:
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto/master/s2clientprotocol/sc2api.proto`
- **One connection can play game after game**, so anything held because it does not change during a game is held
  per game, never per connection.
- **`ResponseGameInfo` never changes during a game.** Ask once, at the start; python-sc2 asks on every step.
- **`ResponseData` changes with the asking player's upgrades, and only with them**, though a unit type has one
  entry and no player. Asked at the start, before any upgrade, it holds the base values both sides share. Each
  unit reports its own upgrade levels, visible enemies' included.
- **`race_actual` in `ResponseGameInfo` is filled only for your own player.**

## Testing

`pytest`. Tests must not require StarCraft II to be installed or running, with the single exception of tests
marked `@pytest.mark.integration`, which a plain `pytest` run deselects. Everything else runs against recorded
protobuf fixtures via the fixture transport.

**The corpus** in `tests/corpus` is five whole games, a bare api losing to the computer on current ladder maps,
recorded by `tools/record_corpus.py`, which says what each one is. Replaying one asks the same questions in the
same order, so a change to what the library asks a game fails `test_corpus.py` until the corpus is recorded
again. The bare api gives no orders, so the only orders in it are those the game gives on its own, nearly all of
them workers mining, and since nothing leaves its base it shows the computer's army but none of its buildings.
